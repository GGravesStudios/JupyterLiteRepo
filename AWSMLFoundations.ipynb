## Exercise: Refactoring â€“ Wine quality
##In this exercise, you'll refactor code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.

##Download the notebook file refactor_wine_quality.ipynb and the dataset winequality-red.csv. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.

##solution

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
df.head()

## Renaming Columns

df.columns = [label.replace(' ', '_') for label in df.columns]
df.head()

## Analyzing Features

def numeric_to_buckets(df, column_name):
    median = df[column_name].median()
    for i, val in enumerate(df[column_name]):
        if val >= median:
            df.loc[i, column_name] = 'high'
        else:
            df.loc[i, column_name] = 'low' 

for feature in df.columns[:-1]:
    numeric_to_buckets(df, feature)
    print(df.groupby(feature).quality.mean(), '\n')
